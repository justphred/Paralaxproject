Podcasting operational change management inside of workflows to establish a framework. Taking seamless key performance indicators offline to maximise the long tail. Keeping your eye on the ball while performing a deep dive on the start-up mentality to derive convergence on cross-platform integration.

Collaboratively administrate empowered markets via plug-and-play networks. Dynamically procrastinate B2C users after installed base benefits. Dramatically visualize customer directed convergence without revolutionary ROI.

Efficiently unleash cross-media information without cross-media value. Quickly maximize timely deliverables for real-time schemas. Dramatically maintain clicks-and-mortar solutions without functional solutions.

Obviously, this is one big hack.  Virtually no work was put into making it
responsive - things break at smaller screen heights and widths.
The overall concept of the multi-layered parallax display, right down to the
change-the-perspective button/function, was "borrowed" from an article written by
Keith Clark and published here: http://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/
I just wanted to try dropping different types of content into the layers to see
what could be done with it.

The graph paper SVG background pattern was found here http://www.heropatterns.com/
I'm continually amazed at the things that people put out into the public domain
for use by others.
